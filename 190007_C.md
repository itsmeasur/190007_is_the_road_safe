We are basically doing image processing here. In deep-learning networks, each layer of nodes trains on a distinct set of features based on the previous layerâ€™s output. Neural networks with single layer is losistic/linear regression and using multiple layers we can fit a non linear model which can't be done by using just linear/logistic regression model. Images have lots of features which needs to be examined and since we cannot fit them in a curve so we need neural networks to extract different features from an image. Therefore, we train our neural network model using enough pictures from MNIST dataset to get more accurate results.
