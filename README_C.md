The type of dataset that I have used is made for neural networks. We are basically doing image processing here. Neural networks are modeled after the human brain and are designed to find patterns. Neural networks help us cluster and classify our data. As the images in dataset are made of pixels and we can represent them in numerical forms. The images are white on the black background so we can give numbers to each pixels according to the grascale range, pure white being 1 and pure black being 0 and then cluster them into neurons. Finally, we can train our neural network model using enough pictures from MNIST dataset.
